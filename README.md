# This is a test repo for google clasp deployment by github actions.

## Instructions

I have used [clasp-token-action](https://github.com/namaggarwal/clasp-token-action) to have the deployment in github actions.

**Note:** You will want to initialize the clasp before the push as the workflow needs clasp.json and appsscript.json
